This is a placeholder file for the LogocraftAI logo PNG image. In a real implementation, this would be a binary PNG file. For the sake of this demonstration, we're using a text file as a placeholder since we cannot directly create binary files through this interface.
 
The actual implementation would require the PNG version of the logo to be properly added to the project. The SVG version we created earlier can be used in the meantime.
